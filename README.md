Codveda Internship Projects 🚀
This repository contains my completed Python development tasks for the Codveda Technology Internship.
The projects span different levels — from basic programming to intermediate API integration and advanced file security.

📂 Project List
🎲 1. Number Guessing Game (Basic)
•	The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
•	The player makes guesses, and the program responds with feedback (Too high / Too low).
•	The game ends when the number is guessed correctly or after the maximum number of attempts.
Skills learned:
•	Loops and conditionals
•	Random number generation (random module)
•	Handling user input
💻 Code: number_guess.py

🌍 2. API Integration (Intermediate)
•	A Python script that connects to a public API (e.g., cryptocurrency prices).
•	Fetches and parses JSON data.
•	Displays results in a user-friendly format.
•	Includes error handling for invalid requests or failed responses.
Skills learned:
•	Working with the requests library
•	Parsing JSON responses
•	External API interaction in Python
💻 Code: api_integration.py

🔐 3. File Encryption/Decryption (Advanced)
•	A Python program that encrypts and decrypts text files using the Fernet encryption algorithm.
•	Ensures sensitive data is stored securely.
•	Provides functionality to recover original content through decryption.
Skills learned:
•	File handling in Python
•	Basics of cryptography and data security
•	Using the cryptography library
•	💻 Code: file_encrypt.py
